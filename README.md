# Alexandria (The Project)
A full-fledged online library manager based on Python, HTML, CSS and JS.

Alexandria is a tribute to the original Library of Alexandria, destroyed by those whom feared open knowledge. 

## Main Goal
To develop a full-fledged online library manager and community of readers interested in sharing what they're reading now but also to keep account of what they've read already. 

Alexandria is meant to be always open-source, free to use and free to modify. Right now we're in dev stage squashing bugs and creating new features. If you wan to check how we're doing so far, you're welcome to try it. You can also help us fixing bugs, suggesting and creating new features as well as improving existing ones.
